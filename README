Please note I'm not liable for anything you use this script at your own risk, if you want to use it commercially please contact me first to seek approval.

I have started create some tools for the BITMAIN TECH S1 Antminer, let me know if you have any requests and I may give it a go.
If you need help installing these you can contact me, but I may expect a tip, the more tips I get the more likely I am to make more scripts :-)

First you will need to have access to your box via ssh and install the ssmtp package.

Goto
System > Software 
Click on update lists
Then look for the package ssmtp, install the package

You will now need to configure the package, to use it you will need login details to a working email account.

Edit the file

/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf 

My configuration file contains the following

root=email_to_send_from@yourdomain.co.uk
mailhub=mail.yoursecuremailserver.com:587
rewriteDomain=yourdomain.co.uk
hostname=yourdomain.co.uk
UseTLS=Yes
UseSTARTTLS=Yes
AuthUser=username@yourdomain.co.uk
AuthPass=password

Obviously though with the above settings swapped for ones that really exist, I use the port 587 as my mail server support TLS

Edit
/etc/ssmtp/revaliases
Add an entry for your email address you are sending from
root:email_to_send_from@yourdomain.co.uk:mail.yoursecureserver.com:587

The above entry must match the setting for root or you are going to have sender verify issues.

Temperature check - temp-check.sh

I put my script in /usr/bin/ you probably want to put it else where but for now that works for me.

remember to chmod +x temp-check.sh

Now open the file up and edit the following settings at the top

alert="where_you_want_your_alerts_sent@yourdomain.co.uk"
hot=42

Set hot to the temperature that you want it to shut the miner down and send you an email. 

Now add the following line to your crontab

You can do this through the web interface or
crontab -e

* * * * * /usr/bin/temp-check.sh

This wil run the temperature check script every minute.

From the web admin you can see if its running in the logs.
